			p I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. In this world, everything can be happy. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.
			p A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. All those little son of a guns. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Take your time. Speed will come later.
			p We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Here we're limited by the time we have. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We can fix anything.
			p Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Be brave. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job.
			p I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. We'll make some happy little bushes here.
			p If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.
			p Son of a gun. There we go. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.
			p Every time you practice, you learn more. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy.
			p Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear.
			p Just make little strokes like that. This painting comes right out of your heart. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy.
			p We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Just use the old one inch brush. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer.
			p Brown is such a nice color. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. At home you have unlimited time. We have a fantastic little sky!
			p It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.
			p Here's another little happy bush We need a shadow side and a highlight side. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Use what you see, don't plan it.
			p So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it.
			p That's crazy. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. And right there you got an almighty cloud.
			p Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. And just raise cain. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun.
			p Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.
			p We'll do another happy little painting. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.
			p If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. You can do it. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. We'll put a happy little sky in here.
			p Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. There it is. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint.
			p Nothing wrong with washing your brush. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Just relax and let it flow. That easy.
			p And maybe, maybe, maybe... Happy painting, God bless. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Only eight colors that you need.
			p In your world you can create anything you desire. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.
			p It's cold, but it's beautiful. There we go. Fluff that up.
			p Zip. That easy. Little short strokes. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important.
			p This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.
			p Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Everybody needs a friend. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.
			p You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.
			p Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.
			p See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Just let these leaves jump off the brush
			p We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.
			p I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. We wash our brush with odorless thinner.
			p Don't be bashful drop me a line. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Let's do that again. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.
			p Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is the fun part
			p I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Poor old tree. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.
			p It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?
			p Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Look at them little rascals. Let that brush dance around there and play.
			p Just beat the devil out of it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Let's get crazy. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue
			p We'll paint one happy little tree right here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Trees grow however makes them happy. In life you need colors.
			p Here's something that's fun. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Let your heart be your guide.
			p This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world.
			p Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Let's have a happy little tree in here. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.
			p If you hypnotize it, it will go away. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. You gotta think like a tree. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.
			p This is a fantastic little painting. Do an almighty painting with us. Just a little indication.
			p If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Let the paint work. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.
			p Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.
			p Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Let all these things just sort of happen.
			p Get tough with it, get strong. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown.
			p We'll have a super time. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license.
			p Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing.
			p Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. It takes dark in order to show light. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff.
			p Now then, let's play. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. The least little bit can do so much. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.
			p You have to make those little noises or it won't work. And maybe a little bush lives there. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.
			p Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. You're meant to have fun in life. You can do anything your heart can imagine. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Let's have a little bit of fun today. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it.
			p Let's get wild today. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. The light is your friend. Preserve it. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Play with the angles. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.
			p These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death.
			p You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Anything you want to do you can do here.
			p Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. You need the dark in order to show the light.
			p Let your imagination be your guide. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Just make a decision and let it go. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.
			p A beautiful little sunset. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.
			p Anyone can paint. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.
			p I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.
			p And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. You can create anything that makes you happy.
			p You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here.
			p We don't want to set these clouds on fire. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. It is a lot of fun. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.
			p It's important to me that you're happy. Let your imagination be your guide. Every day I learn.
			p We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. This piece of canvas is your world.
			p From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. A happy cloud.
			p In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. This is unplanned it really just happens.
			p You have to make these big decisions. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. There we are. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. You are only limited by your imagination.
			p This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. There are no limits in this world.
			p All kinds of happy little splashes. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. There comes a nice little fluffer.
			p All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. I like to beat the brush.
			p Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Put it in, leave it alone. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue.
			p Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? It looks so good, I might as well not stop. You can spend all day playing with mountains.
			p We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. This is your world. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Let's make a nice big leafy tree.
			p There he comes. You can get away with a lot. Very easy to work these to death. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Let's build an almighty mountain. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.
			p The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.
			p Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. See there how easy that is.
			p That easy. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Work that paint. This is gonna be a happy little seascape.
			p See there, told you that would be easy. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. We need dark in order to show light.
			p With practice comes confidence. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. We'll play with clouds today. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.
			p Use your imagination, let it go. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. It all happens automatically. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Don't fight it, use what happens. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.
			p Learn when to stop. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.
			p For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Let's make a happy little mountain now. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. In your world you have total and absolute power. Those great big fluffy clouds.
			p We don't have anything but happy trees here. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Don't fiddle with it all day. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.
			p Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? We'll put a happy little bush here. What the devil. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.
			p Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Imagination is the key to painting. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Working it up and down, back and forth.
			p Have fun with it. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.
			p A fan brush can be your best friend. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun
			p This is truly an almighty mountain. Isn't that fantastic? I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here.
			p It's all a game of angles. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. In this world, everything can be happy.
			p Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. All those little son of a guns. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.
			p Take your time. Speed will come later. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Here we're limited by the time we have. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.
			p We can fix anything. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Be brave.
			p The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.
			p We'll make some happy little bushes here. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.
			p And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Son of a gun. There we go. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.
			p Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Every time you practice, you learn more. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective.
